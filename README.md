# Simple-Adaline
Adaline Algorithm Implementation for AND and OR Gates.

This program implements the Adaline algorithm for the AND and OR gates. The Adaline algorithm is a type of artificial neural network that can be used for supervised learning of binary classification problems. The AND and OR gates are simple binary logic gates that take two input values and produce a single output value based on a predefined logic.

To use the program, simply run the simple_adaline.py file and input the values of A and B when prompted. The program will output the results of the OR and AND gates for the given input values.

Example usage:
```sh
Input the value of A and B: 1 0

The output of OR is: 1

The output of AND is: 0
```
